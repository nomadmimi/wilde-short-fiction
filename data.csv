1;"There is a glut of description and epithet in Mr. Oscar Wilde's book of fairy tales which leaves the reader with a strong sense of having fed on lucent syrup tinct with cinnamon, and baring bad too much of it. No language can compare with it except Ouida's when she is giving an inventory of the properties environing one of her heroines. Few basal ideas in fairy stories can bear this treatment; certainly not Mr. Wilde's. To make matters worse, ho has chosen to relate them in 4 style paraphrasing Scripture, which gives to the whole the air of complexity aping simplicity without success. The weird decorations sown with studied carelessness among the margins heighten this effect, as do also the medieval illustrations and the Grosvenor-Gallery covers Mr. Wilde seems, on the whole, to have taken bis stories something over-solemnly. In a less ostentatious se ting [sic], certain really poetic ideas found floating about in the volume would have gone further towards redeeming the inconsequent and spasmodic construction. The descriptions, in the opening story, of the weaving of the King's robe 'on the loom of Sorrow and by the white hands of Pain', 'the blood in the heart of the Raby, and Death in the heart of be Pearl', have shuddering force, and are among the few things in the book that leave an afterglow in the mind.";A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;6;16;The Nation;United States of America;54;1407;451–452;;Google Books;https://editions.covecollective.org/edition/lord-arthur-savile’s-crime-and-other-stories/appendix-b-contemporary-reviews;2020-02-02;2020-02-02;;File missing
7;We do not like the outside of the cover of Mr Oscar Wilde's *House of Pomegranates* (Osgood) [sic]. The Indian club with a house-painter's brush on the top which passes muster for a peacock, and the chimney-pot  hat with a sponge in it, which is meant to represent a basket containing a pomegranate, or a fountain, or something of that kind, are grotesque, but not ideally so. The inside of the cover, however, with its olive sheaves of corn falling apart, its fluttering quails, and crawling snails, delights the eye. So do the pictures and the type and the paper. Mr Ricketts has learned the art of drawing dreams and visions, and Mr Shannon can make decorative designs full of charming detail. We can well believe that the book is as delightful as it looks.;A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1891;11;28;The Speaker: A Review of Politics, Letters, Science and the Arts;United Kingdom;;;;;Holland and Hart-Davis (2000);https://books.google.es/books?id=CIlNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA26&dq=A+House+of+Pomegranates&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjt9s3O0eH1AhWt4YUKHS5tBY8Q6AF6BAgJEAI#v=onepage&q=A%20House%20of%20Pomegranates&f=false;2021-04-07;2021-04-07;2025-01-17;
11;"An author's opinion on his own work should claim a peculiar respect. Like a fond mother's, his appreciation may incline towards excess; but he, like the mother, sat up with the child. Even if the book send us to sleep, it has probably kept him awake, and that, after all, is the more favourable condition for knowledge. Recognising this, we were not annoyed---as certain critics have been annoyed---to discover, on opening this volume, that Mr. Wilde himself considers the four tales contained in it to be beautiful. We allowed at once that he was possibly, even probably, right; and any small regret at finding our judgment anticipated and our labour curtailed was obliterated in the happy reflection that Mr. Wilde had by this precaution saved himself at least three letters to the newspapers. It is unfortunate that Messrs. Ricketts and Shannon, the illustrators, were not also given a upon which to express their satisfaction with their handiwork. For lack of this, a critic in THE SPEAKER, left to judge without guidance, asserted that the gilt peacock on the cover resembled a bulging umbrella. He has since been corrected and superseded; but it cost Mr. Wilde a postage stamp. The present critic is ready to admit that for decorative ends, in certain places, a peacock which resembles a bulging umbrella may be preferable to the peacock of our gardens: and he follows up this admission with another---that, for decorative ends, the prose of Mr. Oscar Wilde is superior to the prose of other men. You may like decorative prove, or you may not. If you do not, there is no more to be said than that the book is not for your enjoyment. If you do, then the author is right in calling it a book of 'beautiful tales'. From cover to cover, in binding, paper, illustrations and letterpress, the scheme 'of the volume is a scheme of decoration. The title itself is purely decorative. '*A House of Pomegranates*, by Oscar Wilde', reads beautifully, though there be no house and the pomegranates are all contributed by Messrs. Ricketts and Shannon. And the dedications are decorative; so are the margins; and so, above all, is the prose. Here is a passage selected at random---

>…

Now whether we like this kind of thing or not, it is impossible to deny its extreme beauty in its kind. And it is just as impossible to name any other writer who could elaborate his sensuous impressions with such assiduities, minutely careful down to the two sandals on the priest's feet. Among bright colours, sweet sounds, pleasant tastes, Mr. Wilde is like his own Dorian Gray, plunging his hand in gems and letting them rain through his fingers. His pages may be cold reading; but their glitter is amazing, and the fineness of their workmanship, Nor is i¢ merely the sensuous imagery that is decorative. The structure of Mr. Wilde's prose is decorative, too. Take, for example, his description of a mermaid in the third tale :---'Her hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread of fine gold in a cup of glass. Her body was as white ivory, and her tail was of silver and pearl. Silver and pearl was her tail, and the green weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea-shells were her ears, and her lips were like seacoral. The cold waves dashed over her cold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids'. Here is a deliberate and successful adaptation of the old Hebrew trick of repeating a phrase to give balance and rhythm to a sentence, or possibly for the mere pleasure of looking « second time on a cluster of beautiful words. Our poets have made splendid use of this device now and again, and perhaps it has been unduly neglected by our prosewriters. At any rate its decorative value is obvious enough here, as in the Song of Solomon, And having pointed out what we conceive to be Mr. Wilde's purpose, and added our belief that he has attained his purpose with extraordinary skill, we may simply leave readers to decide whether or not their tastes incline towards that which is 'precious' in literature. If they do, they will hardly find two better tales than 'The Young King' and 'The Fisherman and His Soul'. If they do not, the morals of these stories (which, by the way, are not merely irreproachable but beneficent) will be seen sicklied over with detail and cloying to the taste. They will desire a little more of idiom and humanity in the writing, a little less of cadence and artifice. But, after all, they will only be in the position of the critic who objected to a decorative peacock---because it differed from the peacock of his experience.

13;*A House of Pomegranates* is just the sort of title one might expect from Oscar Wilde, and as a matter of course no other firm save that of Jas. R. Osgood, M'Ilvaine [sic] and Co., could fittingly publish for this author. The picture designs and decorations are by C. Ricketts and Ch, [sic] Shannon, an it must be admitted that a more charmingly got-up volume could scarcely be produced. The style is severely antique, and the colours of the kind which aestheticism dictates. So far as a special set of illustrations are concerned the non-initiated will best understand their character by saying that they resemble (while of course far surpassing) what boys call 'transfers' before these are transferred. The paper is of the choicest quality, and it would be difficult to imagine a more elegant gift. Nor is this by any means all that can be said for the volume. Mr. Wilde is always clever and abundant in allusions betraying taste and erudition. But here we have nothing savouring of his customary cynicism. On the title page it is modestly asserted that the contents are 'beautiful tales', and the promise is realised. There are four tales, or rather allegories, and as many dedications, with one extra for the book as a whole, which is to 'Constance Mary Wilde', and a perusal of one or all of 'The Young King', 'The Birthday of the Infanta', 'The Fisherman and his Soul', and 'The Star Child', will be found thoroughly seasonable and wholesome reading. Necessarily the supernatural obtrudes itself, and many situations strange and weird are encountered.;A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1891;12;;The Liverpool Daily Courier;United Kingdom;;;6;;Internet Archive;https://archive.org/details/sim_universal-review_may-august-1888_1/page/304;2022-04-11;2022-04-11;2025-01-17;

43;Mr. Shannon and Mr. Ricketts have sprinkled the pages with devices rare and strange in the latest and straitest school of Neo-pre-Raphaelitism, and the chief illustrations in the book are of a most absolute fancy. Nevertheless, we rather like them, for they are by no means uncomely, and they suit their text---a compliment which we are frequently unable to pay to much more commonplace in- stances of the art of book illustration. In the case of the text, also, hasty judgment is likely to be unduly harsh judgment. The pomegranates that compose the house---the grains that make up the pomegranate would have been a better metaphor---are four in number, and are all tales of the Märchen order, though one is something even more of a fabliau than of a Märchen. This is called 'The Birthday of the Infanta', and tells, to put it very shortly, how a certain little Spanish princess had an ugly dwarf who loved her, and died of a broken heart when he found out, not only how ugly he himself was, but how his beloved mistress thought of him as nothing but a fantastic toy. 'Tis an ower true tale. But we are not sure that Mr. Wilde's manner of telling it is quite the right one. The first and the last of the four, ' The Young King', and ' The Star Child', are pretty enough moralities. The third piece, 'The Fisherman and his Soul', is much longer, as long, indeed, as any two of them, and to our fancy a good deal better. It tells how a fisherman fell in love with a mermaid, and, to gain her, consented to part with his soul. *Spectator*.;A House of Pomegranates;1;Reprinted contemporary review;1892;6;;Book News: An Illustrated Magazine of Literature;United Kingdom;10;118;454;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.12149989&seq=482;2021-06-30;2021-06-30;2025-01-17;
70;"Mr. Oscar Wilde and his coadjutors, Messrs. Ricketts and Shannon, have exhausted the resources of bizarre decoration in '*A House of Pomegranates*', which being interpreted means a quartet of märchen. The book, clad in white linen, with peacocks and arabesques and all sorts of things, is printed on plate paper. Its four, principal illustrations, one for each tale, are executed in such very faint grisaille that even in strong daylight they are not easily decipherable, while artificial illumination makes the page look a blank. There is a profusion of head and tail pieces, often very pretty, not to mention occasional devices scattered over the, angles of the page and everywhere, The inevitable drawback of this sort of thing is that after it one comes to talk and think of the text as 'letterpress'. It says something for Mr. Wilde that his text is nearly if not quite good; enough to banish this injurious appellation from the reader's mind. The tales, dedicated collectively to the author's wife and individually to four other ladies---Lady Brooke, Mrs, Grenfell, the Princess of Monaco, and Miss Margot Lennant,---are, as we have said, märchen, stories of the kind which the Germans invented or resuscitated from its grave in medieval legends, stories with a dash of the supernatural, a strain of pathos, and a suspicion here and---there of persiflage. They are really good of their kind. The best is, we think, 'The Fisherman and his Soul', which is also the most elaborate. The fisherman parts with his soul (though not in the ordinary way) to gain a soulless mermaid, and joins it again only to find---that the mermaid keeps his heart. This is also the most original. 'The Infant's [sic] Birthday', in which a hideous little dwarf dies when he becomes conscious of his ugliness, is very [?].

71;Mr. Oscar Wilde has a vocation. A more charming set of fairy stories will not easily be found than his four stories called *A House of Pomegranates*. It is full of Mr. Oscar Wilde's most happy imagery, and over all is cast the pathos and real kindliness which can be traced even in some books of Mr. Oscar Wilde which are less to our taste. Nothing can be prettier or more pathetic than tho first story of the set, 'The Young King', or more quaintly original than 'The Fisherman and his Soul', which, by the way, raises a scientific question as to whether a shadow can throw a shadow. If we wanted to pick holes, which is the last thing we desire, we should say the stories were almost too ethical. It is as if Mr. Oscar Wilde wished to teach us many things---notably the law of kindness and self-denial, and to enforce the lesson that to do wrong never produces either beauty or happiness. We hasten, however, to state that Mr. Oscar Wilde does not divorce beauty and goodness: If you are good you are beautiful, or, if he will not quite go that length, he insists on the reverse---that if you are bad you are ugly. In future it will be fair to try and read into the other works of Mr. Oscar Wilde the same teaching that is so impressed upon us in this most attractive set of stories. One word must be given to the adornment of the tales. The numerous woodcuts, rather of the style of Mr. Burne Jones, are always clever and sometimes graceful. As to the four photographs, if the fact that it requires not only a very clever person to understand them, but that this person must possess eyes of no common order to make them out, prove that the work is clever, let us at once accord that praise to them.

72;Oscar Wilde's '*A House of Pomegranates*' is a queer production, queerly illustrated with very dim and indistinct cartoons of an aggravating unintelligibility. It is a collection of apologues, or fairy tales, or what you will. It is written in a kind of imitation of Biblical style, and it does not suggest or amount to much, however regarded.;A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;7;17;The New York Tribune;United States of America;;;;;Newspapers by Ancestry;https://www.newspapers.com ;2021-10-19;2021-10-19;;
73;"Is *A House of Pomegranates* intended for a child's book? We confess that we do not exactly know. The ultra-aestheticism of the pictures seems unsuitable for children---as also the rather 'fleshly' style of Mr. Wilde's writing. The stories are somewhat after the manner of Hans Andersen---and have pretty poetic and imaginative flights like his; but then again they wander off too often into something between a 'Sinburnian' ecstasy and the catalogue of a high art furniture dealer. Children may be very much attached to bric-à-brac (though of this we have our doubts), but the more natural among them would certainly prefer Hansel and Grethel's sugar-house to any amount of Mr. Wilde's 'rich tapestries' and 'velvet canopies'. Would they not probably yawn over the following?—

>>'The walls were hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty. A large press, inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaicked gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx’.

The Countess d'Aulnoy's charming tales, it is true, abounded in sumptuary detail, but with her it formed the stage-scenery for her dwarfsand fairies. Again, Mr. Wilde's diction seems to us hardly suitable to children. Joys are 'fierce and fiery-coloured'; the King, watching his little daughter at play, thinks of her dead and embalmed mother, and (this unpleasant suggestion reminds us of Dorian Gray) 'the odours of strange spices, spices such as embalmers use, seemed to taint---or was it fancy?---the clear morning air'. Eyes are of all kinds: 'dark wood-land eyes', 'mauve-amethyst eyes', 'eyes of bossy gold'. A young boy spends a whole night 'in noting the effect of the moonlight on a silver statue of Endymion'. But all Mr. Wilde's stories, whether intended for children or not, have a deep meaning which 'he who runs may read'. This underlying allegory is their chief beauty. 'The Young King' touches on Socialistic economics; 'The Birthday of the Infanta' has a masterly touch of pathos; while 'The Fisherman and his Soul' is perhaps the most far-reaching and most elaborate effort. In this latter there are capital descriptions of the wonders of the sea, as good as some of those in Kingsley.";A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1891;11;30;The Pall Mall Gazette;United Kingdom;;;;;Newspapers by Ancestry;https://www.newspapers.com ;2021-10-19;2021-10-19;;
74;Sir,---I have just been sent from London a copy of the *Pall Mall Gazette* containing a review of my book, '*A House of Pomegranates*'. The writer of this review makes a certain suggestion about my book which i beg you will allow me to correct at once. He starts by asking an extremely silly question, and that is whether or not I have written this book for the purpose of giving pleasure to the British child. Having expressed grave doubts on this subject, a subject on which I cannot conceive any fairly-educated person having any doubts at all, he proceeds, apparently quite seriously, to make the extremely limited vocabulary at the disposal of the British child the standard by which the prose of an artist is to be judged! Now in building this House of Pomegranates I had about as much intention of pleasing the British child as I had of pleasing the British public. Mamilius is as entirely delightful as Caliban is entirely detestable, but neither the standard of Mamilius nor the standard of Caliban is my standard. No artist recognizes any standard of beauty but that which is suggested by his own temperament. The artist seeks to realize in a certain material his immaterial idea of beauty, and thus to transform: an idea into an ideal. That is the way an artist makes things. That is why an artist makes things. The artist has no other object in making things. Does your reviewer imagine that Mr. Shannon, for instance, whose delicate and lovely illustrations he confesses himself quite unable to see, draws for the purpose of giving information to the blind ?---I remain, Sir, your obedient servant, Boulevard des Capucines, Paris.

76;From Messrs James R. Osgood, McIlvaine & Co. we have a quaintly-bound and aesthetically-got-up book by Oscar Wilde, entitled *A House of Pomegranates*, This is the title, but the book has nothing about pomegranates. It consists of four very beautiful fairy tales----The Young King, The Birthday of the Infanta, The Fisherman and his Soul, and The Star Child. The only adjective to apply to these tales is charming.

77;Mr. Oscar Wilde's numerous devotees will no doubt receive his new volume of allegories with enthusiasm, yet even they may perchance be puzzled to understand why he has named it '*A House of Pomegranates*'. The tales, four in number, are for the most part charmingly written, especially 'The Fisherman and his Soul', which has much of the naive grace of the old German legends. As is often the case in the author's work, there is too much elaboration of detail and an absence of the *ars celare artem*, yet the stories are, without exception, marked by poetical feeling. Far less commendable are the illustrations by Messrs. C. Ricketts and C.H. Shannon. For the most part unsatisfactory, the wood-cuts are less so than the full-page illustrations, the latter being in some instances so indistinct as to be hardly comprehensible.;A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;3;16;The Morning Post;United Kingdom;;;;;Newspapers by Ancestry;https://www.newspapers.com ;2021-10-19;2021-10-19;;
79;"Of all men who have consented to adorn the present age, at least within the realm of that Power upon whose domain the sun never sets, none have been the recipients of adulation so profound, intermingled with opprobium so venomous as that bestowed upon Oscar Wilde, That the philosophy for which Mr. Wilde stood, upon his advent into Letters, was, to the Philistine, a new and somewhat startling one, needs no argument; but to prove his sincerity and absoluteness of belief, in its principles, to those congregations of Canaille that he 'has addressed from time to time with his unique suavity, will undoubtedly fall to the good fortune of a future generation. Though Mr. Wilde has now for some years lain, among the data of historic literature, the famous breeches of the Clergy, as well as the flowing locks of Mediævalism, his apostleship to the Spirit of Beauty is not yet ended. Yesterday was produced Dorian Gray, over whose morality two hemispheres wrangled as a nine-days wonder. To-day is given us A House Pomegranates, which Mr. Wilde has stated in print as being; intended neither for the 'British child' nor for the 'British public'. Those for whom a volume so unusual in appearance is produced, will doubtless comprehend the subtlety with which its name was chosen; a subtlety which is brought to,so fine a point that, by no manner of dallying, could he who runs be enabled to read. The book is issued in square octavo, and is printed throughout on heavy, richly toned, Plate Paper, by the Chiswick Press. The decorations have entrusted to Mr. Ricketts and Mr. Shannon, who have succeeded in making the volume a notable target for many who have stationed themselves outside the bastions of Materialism, to leave unmentioned the multitudes within.

*A House of Pomegranates* consists of four allegorical tales: the first two, 'The Young King' and 'The Birthday of the Infanta', may be said to represent the Sorrow of Knowledge, tales of beauty and of pity: the third, 'The Fisherman and his Soul', shows the Power of Love, a story of beauty and strength; while the last, 'The Star Child', in degenerating to the formula of a Teutonic fairy-tale, loses the delicacy of allegorical influence, which is felt with so much power in the others. 'The Fisherman and his Soul' is the tale that will longest be remembered, and, despite the unusual trammels which Mr. Wilde has imposed upon himself, in its motif the story remains a harmony of the most beautiful and fascinating simplicity. In it will be found specimens of the most forcible and picturesque prone ever given by its author. It is nowhere overloaded with that 'gorgeousness of jade and amethyst' which at times satiates the reader in Mr. Wilde's previous work; spices and oriental herbage are used sparingly, and the winds from the seas of the Fisherman bring only odours of salt shores.

The young sea-toiler loses his heart to a mermaid, who will not accept it while he possesses the human soul. Both Priest and Merchant scorn his desire to part with this thing which as he laments, 'I cannot see it, may not touch it, I do not know it'. A young witch, however, rids him of his encumbrance, but she sends it forth without a heart. It wanders to the east and to the south, and gains knowledge and riches unknown to man, which, on returning to its master, are offered in exchange for its old habitation; but to the Fisherman his love is greater than wealth or wisdom. A third time the Soul returns, and this time with the world's pleasures; the temptation is great. What matters it? says the Fisherman to his heart. I can come back to my love: and so to see the dancing feet of an Arab girl the briny home of the Titans is deserted. The Soul leads its master through sin and crime because it has been forced to wander without a Heart; and finally, overwhelmed at the blackness of his own Soul, the Fisherman returns to the shore of his love, where 'every morning he called to the mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night time he spake her name', but she never came in answer to his call. The Soul mocked him, but he continued in his supplication, until one day the black waters arose in a storm, and brought his beloved to his feet, quite dead. The Fisherman clasped the cold form in his arms, and, his heart breaking, the angry sea lapped them both 'round. The proud anathemas of the priest were theirs, and the far corner of the Fuller's field their unmarked grave. On the anniversary of their death the prelate was to address his hearers upon the wrath of God. Arrayed in pontifical robes and exhibiting the monstrance, the odour of the white flowers on the altar troubled him, and to himself all unknown he spoke long and eloquently of God's Love. Upon inquiry, after the service, he found the strange flowers had been gathered from the far corner of the Fuller's field.";A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;;;A Quarter-Yearly Review of the Liberal Arts Called The Knight Errant, Being a Magazine of Appreciation;United States of America;1;1;29–30;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000742515x&seq=41;2022-01-28;2022-01-28;2025-01-17;
80;"*A House of Pomegranates* is a highly decorated quarto volume, printed on paper nearly as thick as cardboard, and profusely illustrated---in a word, it is nothing if not a table-book. Mr. Oscar Wilde's little stories are fanciful and pretty---prettier than the illustrations, some of which---several of the female figures especially---are downright ugly. As for the all but invisible full-sheet engravings---if engravings they are; for it is difficult to speak certainly of things one cannot see---they present, to our eyes, very much the aspect of ordinary prints seen through the veil of protecting tissue paper. But with all the recherche of which the volume bears such evident tokens---within and without---'the trail of the 'Zeit Gheist ' (to garble a well-worn quotation) is over it still'. However Mr. Oscar Wilde may struggle and strive after originality, he cannot emancipate himself from the dull uniformity of contemporary thought and sentiment. The best story by far, and the one which shows the smallest traces of this deadening influence, is 'The Fisherman's Soul' [sic]. 'Il y a de belles choses là dedans', as French professors say in praise of a pupil's version.";A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;4;1;The Westminster Review;United Kingdom;CXXXVII;;225–226;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030664398&seq=233;2022-01-28;2022-01-28;2025-01-21;
81;"Mr. Oscar Wilde has been good enough to explain, since the publication of his book that it was intended neither for the 'British Child' nor for the 'British Public', but for the cultured few who can appreciate its subtle charms. The same exiguous but admiring band will doubtless comprehend why a volume of allegories should be described as *A House of Pomegranates*, which we must confess is not apparent to our perverse and blunted intellect. It consists of four storeys (we mean stories), 'The Young King', 'The Birthday of the Infanta', 'The Fisherman and his Soul', and 'The Star-Child', each dedicated to a lady of Mr. Wilde's acquaintance, and all characterized by the peculiar faults and virtues of his highly artificial style. The allegory, as we have had occasion to remark on former occasions, when discussing the work of Lady Dilke and Miss Olive Schreiner in this particular field, is one of the most difficult of literary forms. In Mr. Wilde's House of Pomegranates there is too much straining after effect and too many wordy descriptions; but at the same time there is a good deal of forcible and poetic writing scattered through its pages, and its scenes have more colour and consistence than those which we criticized in 'Dreams' and 'The Shrine of Love'. Mr. Wilde resembles the modern manager who crowds his stage with aesthetic upholstery and bric-à-brac until the characters have scarcely room to walk about. Take this inventory of the contents of a chamber in the young king's palace, which reads for all the world like an extract from a catalogue at Christie's ... The adornment of these 'beautiful tales', as Mr. Wilde modestly calls them, has been entrusted to Messrs. C. Ricketts and C.H.

82;"Oscar Wilde, in violent admiration of the cover of his latest book, *A House of Pomegranates*, says aesthetically: 'The artistic beauty of the cover of my book resides in the delicate tracing, arabesques, and massing of many coral-red lines on a ground of white ivory, the colour-effect culminating in certain high gilt notes, and being made still more pleasurable by the overlapping band of moss-green cloth that holds the book together'; then he delivers this dictum: 'A thing in Nature becomes much lovelier if it reminds us of a thing in Art, but a thing in Art gains no real beauty through reminding us of a thing in Nature'.";A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;2;1;Current Opinion: A Magazine of Record and Review;United States of America;9;2;320;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106019921185&seq=328;2022-02-02;2022-02-02;2025-01-17;

So struck is he by these visions, that he will have none of the glories with which it is intended to adorn him for his coronation. He goes to the church with a rude cloak of sheepskin and a leathern tunic, and a wreath of wild briar round his head; but the sunlight streaming through the painted window envelops him with such a splendor that none can refuse to honor him. The 'Birthday of the Infanta' shows the pathos of a loving soul lodged in a deformed body. As to 'The Fisherman and his Soul', we cannot exactly see the scope of it. The fisherman gets rid of his soul in order to win the love of a mermaid, and the soul sent out without a heart commits all kinds of atrocities. That is a fine idea; but the purport of the whole eludes us. Mr. Wilde writes, as usual, in a highly ornate style, often beautiful, but somewhat fatiguing.
";A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;3;19;The Spectator;United Kingdom;67;3325;408;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b000548512&seq=7;2022-02-02;2022-02-02;2025-01-21;
84;"We fear that Mr. Oscar Wilde's enemies (supposing him to be capable of possessing any) must have seen in this handsome book a deliberate provocation to the bourgeois au front glabre. Amid the pomegranates and other trimmings on the cover, there is a back view of a peacock which looks for all the world like that of an elderly spinster with her hands behind her back, and her profile turned towards the beholder. Mr. Shannon and Mr. Ricketts have sprinkled the pages with devices rare and strange in the latest and straitest school of Neo-Preraphaelitism, and the chief illustrations in the book are of a most absolute fancy. Mr. Wilde has, we observe, protested in the public press against the judgment that they are invisible, and, strictly speaking, they are not. But being printed in very faint grisaille on very deeply cream-tinted plate paper, they put on about as much invisibility as is possible to things visible, and as they are arranged, neither facing letterpress nor with the usual tissue guard, but with a blank sheet of paper of the same tint and substance opposite them, a hasty person might really open the leaves and wonder which side the illustration was. Nevertheless, we rather like them, for when you can see them, they are by no means uncomely, and they suit their text---a compliment which we are frequently unable to pay to much more commonplace instances of the art of book illustration. 
In the case of the text, also, hasty judgment is likely to be unduly harsh judgment. The pomegranates that compose the house---the grains that make up the pomegranate would have been a better metaphor---are four in number, and are all tales of the Märchen order, though one is something even more of a fabliau than of a Märchen. This is called 'The Birthday of the Infanta', and tells, to put it very shortly, how a certain little Spanish princess had an ugly dwarf who loved her, and died of a broken heart when he found out, not only how ugly he himself was, but how his beloved mistress thought of him as nothing but a fantastic toy. 'Tis an ower true tale. But we are not sure that Mr. Wilde's manner of telling it is quite the right one. The first and the last of the four, 'The Young King', and 'The Star Child', are pretty enough moralities; the first of halfmediaeval, half-modern Socialist strain. The other tells how a child was cured of cruelty, partly by some metaphysical aid, partly (we do not know whether Mr. Wilde intended to draw this part of the moral, but he has) by sound beatings and a not excessive allowance of bread and water. 

But the third piece, 'The Fisherman and his Soul', is much longer, as long, indeed, as any two of them, and to our fancy a good deal better. It tells how a fisherman fell in love with a mermaid, and, to gain her, consented to part with, but not in the ordinary fashion to sell, his soul; how after a time he grew weary of his happiness, went to look after his soul, and found her, divorced as she was from his or any heart, a rather unpleasant, not to say immoral, companion; how he in vain endeavoured to return once more to his mermaid and only found her dead, when he and she and the soul were reunited once for all; and how, when the dead bodies of the pair were found and buried in unhallowed ground, there came a miracle converting to charity the heart of the parish priest who had cast them out. The separate ingredients of the piece are, of course, not very novel; but, to tell the truth, the separate ingredients of a story of this kind hardly can be, and Mr. Wilde has put them together with considerable skill, and communicated to the whole an agreeable character. The little mermaid is very nice, both when she is caught literally napping, and when she sings, and when she explains the necessity of her lover parting with his soul if he will have her. Also the young witch (to whom, when the parish priest has, not unnaturally, declined to unsoul him, the fisherman goes) is pleasing. She had red hair, and in gold tissue embroidered with peacock's eyes and a little green velvet cap she must have looked very well. The Sabbath, too, is good (there are too few Sabbaths in English), though the gentlemanly Satan is not new. Good, too, is the business-like manner in which the fisherman separates his soul from him by a device not impossibly suggested by one Adelbert von Chamisso, a person of ability. The adventures of the discarded and heartless soul are of merit, and it is a very good touch to make the fisherman's final, and hardly conscious, desertion of his mermaid-love turn on nothing more than a sudden fancy to dance, and the remembrance that she had no feet and could not dance with him. It is particularly satisfactory to learn that the mermaid's tail was of pearl-and-silver. There has been an impression in many circles that mermaids' tails are green, and we have always thought that it would be unpleasant to embrace a person with a green tail. But pearl-and-silver is quite different.";A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;2;6;The Saturday Review;United Kingdom;LXXIII;1893;160;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044010020865?urlappend=%3Bseq=176%3Bownerid=114516320-196;2022-02-02;2022-02-02;2025-01-21;

86;This consists of four stories---'The Young King', 'The Birthday of the Infanta', 'The Fisherman and his Soul, and 'The Star Child'. They are each distinguished by the delicate grace which the author is capable of imparting to works of romance, and are extremely fascinating. 'The Young King' shows how that monarch, a lad of but sixteen, had, on succeeding to the throne of his father, a strange and secret yearning for the beautiful. One day he feels peculiarly drowsy. 'Outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a bubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and down on the misty terrace by the river. Far away in an orchard a nightingale was singing. A faint perfume of jasmin [sic] came through the open window. He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and, taking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the chords. His heavy eyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him. Never before had he felt so keenly or with such exquisite joy the magic and the mystery of beautiful things'. He now has three dreams and in these dreams he is shown how the beautiful jewels and dresses he so much admires are produced---the men who lose their lives in diving for pearls, the poor labourers, young and old, who toil at weaving. And the young king's eyes are marvellously opened, and he refuses the bright things he would otherwise have joyously accepted. It is a beautifully told allegory, and the same may be said of the other contents of the volume. The design and decoration of the book are by C. Ricketts and C. H.

87;"Of illustrated books recently published, the following demand more than a mere note; there would not be room else to show the character of the illustrations, which are in each case so important a feature. For the sake of his reputation as a worshipper at the shrine of Beauty it is to be regretted that Mr, Oscar Wilde has told us that he 'admires immensely' the design of the cover for his new book of fairy tales---it may reasonably be supposed that the cover of a book should in itself be attractive, even if it be ugly, for it must be admitted that there is sometimes an extraordinary attractiveness and fascination about ugliness; but ... Wilde's cover is not ugly enough to be fascinating, though it would be difficult to find a design ... similar purpose so devoid of charm. 
No more need have been said about this cover had not Mr. Wilde attempted to defend it, and by description and argument, ... tried to make us like it against our better judgment. A critic wrote that a portion of the design of the left hand side of the cover reminded him of 'an Indian club with a house-painter's brush on the top of it', while a portion on the right suggested to him the idea of 'a chimney pot hat with a sponge in it'. As a matter of fact, the one is intended to be a back view of a peacock, and the other to be some sort of fountain; but they certainly are more like the objects mentioned by the critic, In the Speaker of December 5th, Mr. Wilde attempts to show that it does not matter what the details of a design suggest---peacocks, pomegranates, splashing fountains of gold water, or Indian clubs and chimney-pot hats---it is a matter of indifference, and has nothing to do with the aesthetic quality and value of the design; and this would have been true had Mr. Wilde been speaking of forms used in repetition to produce a pattern, Almost any form may be used for this purpose, and a good result obtained; but the peacock and the fountain, or the club and chimney-pot hat, are objects separate from the pattern on the cover. They are large, independent figures, standing by themselves, and are emphasized by being in gold. Under such circumstances it matters very considerably what the form may be, though, if the form be beautiful, the object it represents may be a matter of indifference; bat, clever as Mr. Wilde may be, it will puzzle him to discover a single beautiful line or form about this disputed portion of his design. The drawings by Mr. Ricketts, which embellish but hardly illustrate the stories, have a good deal of that interest which attaches to his work generally. For such small illustrations they are, perhaps, drawn in rather too coarse a line; but Mr, Ricketts evidently admires and follows the old German and Italian line drawings, and there is no doubt about their admirable simplicity. But the coarser lines of the old engravings were due to the necessary coarseness of their execution and materials, and not to choice. The work had to obey the limits of tools, and this working within imposed limits produces what we understand as 'style'. We do not care to discuss the question whether a modern artist should impose on himself limits unavoidable by the old masters, but net necessary to us. Every artist decides such matters for himself. Personally, we prefer Mr. Ricketts when he works with a finer line; but, whatever the thickness of his line, his pen-work is always interesting and never commonplace. As to the drawings by Mr. Shannon we cannot sty anything, because we cannot see anything. We can only suppose that Mr. Wilde is ashamed of them, but, having commissioned them, felt bound to use them. They are printed on separate pages, but in so faint a tone that it is simply affectation to have printed them at all. If it is purposely done to prevent the seeing of intention in the artist's work, it is perfectly successful.";A House of Pomegranates;1;Original contemporary review;1892;1;1;The Magazine of Art;United Kingdom;15;;135–136;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015018393531?urlappend=%3Bseq=162%3Bownerid=13510798897081713-174;2022-02-03;2022-02-03;2025-01-21;

Thackeray and Kingsley both tried their hands at what, for the sake of a better and more comprehensive word, we call fairy-tales. The ' Rose and the Ring', and the 'Waterbabies', have become 'classics of the nursery ' and schoolroom, and for many years there have been floods of translations from Russian, Scandinavian, and Eastern sources, to say nothing of originals like 'Alice in Wonderland', or Lord Brabourne's and Mr. Andrew Lang's *märchen*. Mrs. Molesworth's Four-Winds Farm is a delightful book, and Mr. Oscar Wilde has written some very imaginative stories, perhaps more ethical in their suggestive meaning than we might have expected from a cynical dramatist. His House of Pomegranates is in some ways akin to Dr. George Macdonald's collection, but is more mystical and less purely fanciful. It is sumptuously decorated and illustrated by Mr. C. Ricketts and Mr. Charles Shannon, and in the descriptive passages by which the author seeks to emulate in words the patient skill of the medieval illuminator, we recognise the hand of a leader of the modern esthetic school. The following from 'The Young King' is a good specimen of Mr. Wilde's decorative word-painting:

>'The walls were hung with rich tapestries, representing the Triumph of Beauty. A large press, inlaid with agate and Lapislazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass anda cup of dark-veined onyx. Pale poppies were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from the tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the velvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like white foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling. A laughing Narcissus, in green bronze, held a polished mirror above its head. On the table stood a flat bowl of amethyst'. 

Such passages after a while pall on the reader, as a banquet chiefly composed of luscious fruits and perfumed wines would pall on the appetite, and cause longings for a cool draught of water and the simple fare of childhood. The 'Birthday of the Infanta' is the best of the four stories in Mr. Wilde's volume; it has a less artificial air than the others, and the contrast between the stately Spanish children surrounded by their courtly retinue, and the dwarf who for the first time comes face to face with his own ugly misshapen image, and breaks his heart at the discovery, is both pathetic and dramatic.
But after all, it is to the old ' nursery classics' that we return with renewed zest, and best among all collections of old-world lore is Grimm's Household Tales. It is a veritable storehouse of legend and fairy-tale, we find most of our friends there, Cinderella perhaps a little different from her English namesake, but, at least, not barbarously maltreated as by the late George Cruickshank, who turned her story into a temperance tract. It seems necessary to scientific minds to discover scientific reasons for everything that exists, even for fairy-tales, but it is enough for most people to realise that they are the heritage of children, who, as a rule, prefer the old ' wild tales' to the most elaborate preparation of modern invention.

40;"The humour of Oscar Wilde's jeu d'esprit thus entitled is of a very different order. As pure farce---and what can be better than farce at its best?---it deserves to live; for it is independent of passing circumstances, and is written with all the grave, simple, matter of fact seriousness which is more essential to farce than to tragedy. Nobody with the slightest sense of humour, or, for that matter, nobody with the strongest, can fail to enjoy the story of a man to whom murder presented itself in the light of a simple duty. It is worth all Mr. Wilde's serious work put together. The stories which follow are also excellent, and their author is to be congratulated on having introduced an entirely new and original ghost to the world---no slight feat in these days. But for its degeneration into sentiment, the story in which it appears would be almost as good in its way as that of 'Lord Arthur's Crime'.

62;"The straiter sect of Oscarians may perhaps shake their heads over Mr. Oscar Wilde's book, [of] reprint, *Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, and Other Stories* (London: Osgood, McIlvaine, and Co ...). Except in the description of Lord Arthur's bathroom and bath, the usual wildings of the author's fancy are for the most part absent; there are few derangements of epitaphs, and the whole, even when it is paradoxical, is paradoxical in a simple and straightforward kind of way. The topsy-turvifying in the first story, if insisted on a little too long---the great danger in all these things,---is not unfunny. Lord Arthur Savile, a young man of great beauty (and of more personal goodness than sometimes appertains to Mr, Wilde's young men of great beauty), is engaged (also a good sign) to a girl of marvellous loveliness, Suddenly he is told by a cheiromancer that he will commit a murder. Lord Arthur's high-souled chivalry concludes that it would be base to marry with this doom banging over him, and that the only thing to do is to put the marriage off and get the murder over. 'The unexpected difficulties which arise and the final success may be leftto the reader. The thing, of course, is not original: De Quincey, Champfleury, Mr. Stevenson, and others may claiin royalty on it; but it is fairly done. The other chief story, 'The Canterville Ghost', is a rather quaint combination of a burlesque and a bluette---of Mark Twain and Musaeus, The poor ghost passes into the possession of an American family, and finds all his wonted terrors frustrated by their unfeeling modernity. Yet he is 'laid' at last in the most authentic and romantic manner by Virginia, the daughter of the house.

64;"Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, and other Stories' By Oscar Wilde. (Osgqood, Mcllvaine and Co.) The story which gives this little book its name is a piece of logico-whimsicality by Mr. Oscar W. S. Gilbert Wilde. Its subtitle is 'A Study in Duty', just as the subtitle of 'The Pirates of Penzance' was 'The Slave of Duty'. The hero of the opera committed piracy, the hero of the story commits murder, from a sense of duty. In both the author has an odd semblance of satirizing something--heaven only knows what. It is irony in the air---or rather in a vacuum---but it makes pleasant enough reading none the less. 'The Sphinx without a Secret' is a subject for a sketch by M. Oscar Ivanovitch Wilde-Turgueneff [sic], lt is a psychological study with the psychology Ieft out, 'The Canterville Ghost' is a skit on psychical research by Mr. O. A, Lang-Wilde--which accounts for its being a trifle langweilig. The author appears to have taken his inspiration from the following passage in ' The Tour to the Hebrides' : Boswed' Would not you, sir, start as Mr. Garrick does if you saw a ghost?' Johnson: 'I hope not. If I did, I should frighten the ghost'. The ' hylo-idealistic romance' (so the sub title runs) is very like 'In Castle Perilous', but not so amusing. The fourth and last story, entitled 'The Model Millionaire', is an edifying fairy tale by Herr Hans O. Andersen-Wilde. The moral is that if, on encountering a picturesque beggar, you find that you have only a sovereign and some coppers in your pocket, the prudent course is to give him the sovereign on the chance of his turning out to be Baron Hirsch in disguise. There is at least an even chance that he will employ your sovereign in disguising himself---in drink, But the generous soul will decline to dwell on such sordid contingencies.

67;"THOUGH the public does not care much for short stories they continue to be published. The prolific Mr. Oscar Wilde obliges the town with his 'Lord Arthur Savile's Crime' (Osgood and McIlvaine), which need not detain us long, as indeed it does not long detain the reader. The right kind of student will enjoy no inconsiderable number of grins over Mr. Wilde's work, but the general reader will feel that he is being played with. There are times when a child could play with the general reader, his appetite for ' bob's vorths', doses of drivel at a shilling, is marvellous. Nobody knows why, out of a hundred shilling novels, perhaps one succeeds, while the others fail. Like mining ventures, the production of shilling novels is a perfect hazard,: Only one thing is certain, that the pure chaser does not like being trifled with when once he feels that he is not taken seriously. Now Mr. Wilde takes neither himself, nor his tales, nor the reader seriously, for which we would be the last to blame him. His first story, the 'Crime of Lord Arthur Savile', is a Bab Ballad, in prose, and writ large. It is an exercise in the topsy turvy, the humour of murder is the topic, and that might be left to De Quincy. Then there is a ghost of the broadly waggish kind, reminding us of other comic ghosts, but not to be favourably compared with the on of Mr. Anstey. The ghost story ends, unexpectedly, with a little sentiment. There is also two brief anecdotes; one of them was capable of being made more interesting. That is all, and the whole, though nicely printed, if not very filling at the price of one florin.

Mr. Wilde's little book is only one out of a crowd of new volumes containing brief tales. On the topic of such a a very great deal has been written of late, by critics, mainly by American critics. They speak of 'The Short Story' with deep solemnity, as if it were an important phenomenon in literature, like Tragedy, or Epic, or The Ode. Perhaps the subject is too seriously treated. There have always been differences of length in stories. Some people unfold their narrative in three volumes; some in six pages. In England, the public prefer long novels. The reason, probably, is that the attention of the reader needs only once to be fairly aroused in a long novel if the novel be readable at all. In a volume of a dozen short stories, on the other hand, the attention needs to be wakened up a dozen times, and this is fatiguing. Again, there be many authors who say that if once they have a good situation, al| good notion, they cannot afford to waste it in a few pages. Except for the manual labour they find it just as easy, and a great deal more remunerative, to fill three volumes. Thus novels; are written, and are read, on the lines oft least resistance. Some years ago Mr. FREDERICK BOYLE had a good notion, He published it as a short story, 'The Fetich City', and while it greatly impressed its readers, they were comparatively. few. Similar notions, worked out at length, were later vastly successful, and much in demand. We like body and substance and weight in a tale; we are not content with a suggestion, however admirable many of Mr. R. L. STEVENSON's short stories were excellent, but one man knows them, to twenty who know his more elaborate legends. We have, perhaps, only one modern English, or rather one Anglo-Indian author, whose brief narratives are really popular, and critics keep demanding a long one from him. Apparently, in England money and reputation can hardly be made by brevity. We have no Decameron and in our hearts privately we wonder at the fame of that collection. Hawthorne would be very little known if he were merely the author of 'Twice Told Tales' and of 'Mosses from an Old Manse'. By brief tales Poe indeed won a great reputation, but not an adequate income. As far as money-making goes, he was born too early. Were Poe living now, what a 'boom' he would enjoy and how great would be his price among the Magazines! He did not live long enough to be properly discovered, talked about, and advertised.

The reasons why short stories have not been so successful in Anglo-Saxon lands, as in the native country of the conte, are therefore sufficiently obvious. These reasons are likely to continue in force, Authors will be economical of their inventions, and the public of its attention and interest. Novels will be stuffed with padding, and will meander through three volumes. Our literary tastes will go on being leisurely. One can hardly fancy FIELDING at work on short stories, still less RICHARDSON. These great geniuses needed elbow room. SCOTT notably preferred plenty of space, though he wrote the best of all short stories, 'Wandering  Willie's Tale', and others like 'The Tapestried Chamber' and 'The Laird's Jock', which were excellent. Given an anecdote as a nucleus or germ, and he produced a long romance Mr. KIPLING could have made an excellent conte of six pages out of the dark tradition of the STAIR family. SCOTT preferred to expand it into the 'Bride of Lammermoor', and the world has not regretted his choice. Out of the material of 'The Stolen Letter', Mr. WILKIE COLLINS would easily have spun 2 novel; out of 'The Gold Beetle', another author could have made 2 volume. The more lengthened narrative might have excelled the briefer in contemporary vogue: as to duration the shorter shape seems to have merits. It is, probably, much 2 matter of chance whether a given nucleus is cut down too conte, or expanded into a volume by M. GUY DE MAUPASSANT. In turning over HAWTHORNE'S Note-books we perceive that he could use his notions in either way, exactly as he happened to prefer. Round the essential persons, the essential idea, other ideas and persons rapidly group themselves. The central ides of Mr LEFANU's 'Uncle Silas' was originally an anecdote, and appeared in a brief tale. Afterwards a long romance crystallised around this centre. The question is whether more is lost or gained practically, and for the author's art, by letting the idea expand itself. Authors can decide this for themselves, in accordance with their genius and intellectual habits. In England and America they are likely to obey the law of gravitation, and move in the direction of the greater mass. It is plain, indeed, that they ere even too well disposed to do this, and to expand, or rather to dilute, a notion into three volumes; to offer a huge canvas, where a sketch would suffice. Young authors, beginners, would save themselves much disappointment by trying their skill in half a dozen pages, before trying to become voluminous. But they always ambitious of bigness, to their own sorrow, and in face of frequent rejections.

68;"A rumour was spread abroad the other day that the great Oscar had cut his hair and donned the frock coat of respectability. This dainty little volume proves that with shearing of his locks his great strength---his wit and his humour---has not gone out of him. The stories are gems, but the dazzling facets are not too many; in short (as Mr Micawber used to say), the style is not, as of yore, overloaded with epigram. There are some pretty inventions scattered through the volume too. 'The inordinate passion for pleasure, which is the secret of remaining young', is not so good as 'women over lifesize', but it will pass; so will 'The proper basis for marriage is mutual misunderstanding', and 'The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast'. The title-tale, 'Lord Arthur Savile's Crime', is saved by its humour from being a 'horrible'. The young man, who is about to be married, is told by a cheiromantiat that his hand indicates that he must murder a relative, and after a night of agony he 'sets about the jab, The details are a little gruesome, but there is unmistakable humour in the relation of his Lordship's failures, each of which necessitates a further postponement of his wedding; and the dénouement would be clever were if not that the victim who dress the murderers weird, unfortunately does net satisfy the conditions---he is not a relative; but the greatest novelists make slips like that. The tone of another of the stories is rollicking fun, with an undertone of somewhat cheap pathos. It relates the efforts of an American diplomatist and his family to lay a real ancestral, aristocratic, English ghost, and is most amusing. The Yankees take the phantom seriously but calmly, rub out his pet bloodstains with Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent, and offer him an equally efficacious lubricant for his chains. But the book is worth buying for the working out of the plot. One morsel demands quotation. Having expressed a dislike to America, the ghost is asked satirically if the reason is because America has no ruins and no 'curiosities. 'No ruins! No curiosities!' answered the spirit, 'you have your navy and your manners'.";Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories;1;Original contemporary review;1891;7;23;The Glasgow Herald;United Kingdom;;;;;Newspapers by Ancestry;https://www.newspapers.com ;2021-10-18;2021-10-18;;
69;Mr. Oscar Wilde is about to follow the example of all who make a hit the field of fiction. He is going to republish some short stories contributed to the magazines in the days when he was a more notorious but less famous man than he now is. The temptation profitably to get rid of one's early work is, of course, very great, and it is seldom resisted, In the present case the author has done his best to Improve his youthful efforts by rewriting, recasting and revising where necessary. Four stories have been deemed worthy of republication: 'Lord Arthur Savile's Crime', 'The Canterville Ghost', 'The Sphinx Without a Secret' and 'A Model Millionaire'. The first-named story will give the volume its title. It will be published simultaneously in England and America.;Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories;1;Original contemporary review;1891;8;2;The Times;United States of America;;;;;Newspapers by Ancestry;https://www.newspapers.com ;2021-10-18;2021-10-18;;
78;Mr. Oscar Wilde's little book of stories is capital. They are delightfully humorous, witty, and fresh, sparkling with good things, full of vivacity, and well put together. 'The Canterville Ghost' is a first-rate ghost story, told partly from the point of view of the ghost himself---a most refreshing novelty--and partly from that of the American family who have bought the ancestral home of the Cantervilles. 'Lord Arthur Savile's Crime' is a very good story, too, told in a vein of drollery which is quite distinctive.

3;"THIS little collection of stories for children (hardly longer than a review article shows Mr. Oscar Wilde's genius at its best. The five tales have each a point, are admirably expressed, and show a genuine poetic feeling. What, for instance, could in its slight way be more neatly told than the story which gives the name to the book? The ' Happy Prince' is a great gold statue in the market-place of the town where he once lived and ruled, and since he has been set up on his pedestal he has seen all the woe and want of his city---for the first time. So one by one he parts with his sword-hilt jewels and his sapphire eyes to relieve his people, making a swallow his messenger, and then---but that should be left to the author.

4;"The gift of writing fairy tales is rare, and Mr. Oscar Wilde shows that he possesses it in a rare degree. The Happy Prince, and other Stories, are full of charming fancies and quaint humour. Though with a distinct character of their own, they are not unworthy to compare with Hans Andersen, and it is not easy to give higher praise than this. There is a piquant touch of contemporary satire which differentiates Mr. Wilde from the teller of pure fairy tales; but it is so delicately introduced that the illusion is not destroyed and a child would delight in the tales without being worried or troubled by their application, while children of larger growth will enjoy them and profit by them. The illustrations are charming.";The Happy Prince and Other Tales;1;Original contemporary review;1888;9;1;The Athenaeum;United Kingdom;;;286;;Karl Beckson;;2021-03-29;2021-03-29;2025-01-17;
5;"One of the chief functions of the true fairy story is to excite sympathy. Whether they are princes, peasants, or inanimate objects (Was the immortal tin soldier an inanimate object?), the joys and sorrows of the heroes and heroines of fairyland will always be real to those persons, whatever their age may be, who love the fairy story, and regard it as the most delightful form of romance. Mr. Oscar Wilde, no doubt for excellent reasons, has chosen to present his fables in the form of fairy tales to a public which, though it should count among its numbers most persons who can appreciate delicate humour and an artistic literary manner, will assuredly not be composed of children. No child will sympathize at all with Mr. Wilde's Happy Prince when he is melted down by order of the Mayor and Corporation in obedience to the dictum of the art professor at the University that, since 'he is no longer beautiful, he is no longer useful'. Children do not care for satire, and the dominant spirit of these stories is satire---a bitter satire differing widely from that of Hans Andersen, whom Mr. Wilde's literary manner so constantly recalls to us. This quality of bitterness, however, does not repel the reader (except in the story of the 'Devoted Friend', which is at once the cleverest and least agreeable in the volume), inasmuch as Mr. Wilde always contrives to leave us at the
 end of every tale with a very pleasant sensation of the humorous. Perhaps the best example of Mr.Wilde's method is to be found in 'The Nightingale and the Rose'. Here the nightingale has sacrificed its life in order to obtain a red rose for the student. The student repairs with the nightingale's gift to the daughter of the Professor, in order to present the rose to her:

>'But the girl frowned. 'I am afraid it will not go with my dress', she answered; 'and besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flower. '
>Then the student, having thrown away the rose, returns to a great dusty book, reflecting:---
>'What a silly thing Love is. It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen... In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics'

It may be remarked in connexion with this story that, in order to get the desired effect at the conclusion, Mr. Wilde has gone dangerously near the region of sham sentiment.

17;"This is a clever book by a clever man, who has not yet altogether done justice to himself. Mr. Wilde can scarcely have intended these five tales, which (notably the first) are illustrated by Mr. Walter Crane and Mr. Jacomb Hood in a style which may be described as impressionism tempered by elegance, for boys and girls. Their note is melancholy, and a subtle sarcasm pervades them which will puzzle young readers. Take, as a specimen of this sarcasm, these two sentences from the first page of the first and best of the stories, ""The Happy Prince :’— He [the statue of the Prince] was very much admired indeed. ‘He is as beautiful as a weathercock,’ remarked one of the Town Councillors, who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; ‘only not quite so useful,’ he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.” Mr. Wilde’s sarcasm occasionally seems akin to cynicism, as in "" The Nightingale and the Rose,” which is a story of self-sacrifice wasted. The teaching conveyed in most of the tales, particularly in ""The Happy Prince,” ""The Selfish Giant,” and ""The Re- markable Rocket,” is essentially sound, being to the effect that unselfishness is moral beauty, and that vain display is moral ugliness. In the literature of fable, there has probably appeared nothing so pathetic as the story of the little swallow which is included in that of ""The Happy Prince.” The public will look forward with much interest to Mr. Oscar Wilde’s giving them a second instalment [sic] of his dainty wisdom.";The Happy Prince and Other Tales;1;Original contemporary review;1889;3;2;The Spectator;United Kingdom;62;3166;309;;Google Books;https://www.google.es/books/edition/The_Spectator/sLU-AQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22The+Happy+Prince+and+Other+Tales%22&pg=RA1-PA309&printsec=frontcover;2025-01-20;2025-01-20;2025-01-20;
18;"Recent newspapers have brought the information that the authorities of the British Museum have with drawn from circulation all books written by Mr. Oscar Wilde. For this performance there has been applause on all sides. It has been hailed as a most righteous judgment and a noble act of justice. Preachers have approved, moralists have commended, the Prevention of Vice people have been loud in their praises and now the critics also come in with their cheers. For most of these there is the old excuse of utter and growling ignorance and on that score one must-we suppose-forgive them. In the present instance, however, it is cowardly and small. They have struck a man when he is down. They have kicked a body when life was nearly gone and they found pleasure in doing it-they-the erudite, the honest, the just critics.

As to certain criminal proceedings not long past, fortunately there can be but one opinion. But that Mr. Wilde may be guilty of all immoralities conceivable and inconceivable is neither here nor there. It is not the man but his work of which there is question. And sad precedentin the lives of Poe and Byron and Shelley-has lead us to see the necessity of disassociating a man from his work. In truth much of Mr. Wilde's writing is immoral. The evidence of immorality is not to be found in the records of any court of justice, however, but in the books themselves. ""The Picture of Dorian Grey,"" ""The Sphinx,"" and ""Salome"" are bad books. If the curators of the British Museum have failed in time past to see this it adds only to a belief in their stupidity. On the other hand the ""Poems,"" ""The House of Pomegranates,"" ""The Happy Prince and Other Tales"" are pure and charming. No man in our generation has written better fairy tales. These also the authorities have withdrawn from circulation.

If there ever was in any of Mr. Wilde's writings literary merit and beauty, which may perhaps originally have lead the Museum to purchase the works, the same merit and beauty still exist and will continue to exist. Once and for all, a book printed and given to the public has a life wholly its own and independent of the fortunes of its author. Even should we discover that Shakspeare himself had committed sins against a dozen decalogues, it would not alter by one hair's breadth the wonder of his poetry. This is a far cry, but the question is one of principle and justice and not of the values at stake. The performance of the curators of the British Museum is an act of bigoted and blind fury. It is narrow-minded and indiscriminating. One must protest.";The Happy Prince and Other Tales;2;Original contemporary review;1895;5;1;The Chap-book: Semi-monthly.

20;"BURLESQUES AND FATRY TALES.*
TliKRK would seem to _lu: quite _;i revival in I'airy literature. Within a very recent period many pretentious volumes have been published dealing with goblin and cllin lore—some treatises, almost scientific in their hard matter-of-fact, dry, grave, and serious analysis of the popular stories, pointing out the origin of them, detesting resemblances between them and Persian myths or Saga's songs, explaining andexploding with a vandalism that spares no illusions, however cherished or time-sanctified—others simply relating, as if with faith and credence, the legends whoso recital Iki.s for many an ago brightened tlio hearthsides and brought pleasure! not unmixed with ill-mastered dread to the hearts of successive generations of listeners. Into these latter, however, the spirit of modern utilitarianism—if it maybe styled so—has in a manner infused itself ; and in the cleft hands of the later reciter they bike a new character, hiding a moral or a sting under their seeming innocent guile_:lessne$s. Poor fairy and sprite, they have been in these latter days _remorselessly hauled into politics and chained to the wheel of its iron car. Few things now, indeed, are altogether what they seem ; something lurks under all the outward appearances, and, perhaps, one should not wonder that even the children's fairy tale should undergo the new influence and change like all things else. Just as, taught by sad necessity, we have, learned to search in almost everything for its cunningly hidden undermeaning or point, so one in reading the simplest composition is harassed at every stage by the oppressive self-suggested questions—Is that anything new 1 Is there any political reference in it? Is there any social grievance hinted at here ? Mr. Oscar Wilde with his ""Happy Prince"" and his ""Remarkable Rocket broke up new ground, and others have not been slow to follow him. Oftener than not, it is the case that the first in the field has the greatest success, and so it seems to be here. Mr. Frank Hudson is charming, bright, racy, humorous, and winning, but he lacks in some of his work that lightness of touch, _iiiriwss_, indelinable grace, and delicate fancy which are never wanting in Mr. Wilde. He has, though, qualities of his own, which in part, though not altogether, make up for the deficiency. One thing, he is less subtle ; his meaning is more easily apprehended. Yet, perhaps, by reason of this very circumstance lie _losers somewhat of his end ; his stories lie intends for ""little people and big,"" and precisely as they are more appropriate for childish reading through the simplicity nf the substance nnd the stvle of the narration, so are thev less suitable for elders, while on the other hand those which best lend themselves to ""reading between the lines,"" which have a weightier purpose as it were, in the same degree are less effective in interesting and delighting the young. In most of Oscar Wilde's fanciful and highly poetical work of the kind, it might bo said in all, such is his cunning and skill that the pleasure and the profit are so interlaced and combined that each story is equally good in either. But to say that Mr. Hudson falls short of him is not, after all, great censure. Indeed, no one could read these little stories and preserve an unfriendly critical attitude towards them. They are like good wine, they bear their own commendation with them and argument as to the excellence of the vintage is undreamt of. The first is, perhaps, the least meritorious performance ; vet it is highly ingenious in its conception, giving, as it dons, a novel and amusing explanation of the origin of that famous institution, the Plum Pudding. Tim Blink, the tinker, after a too long sojourn at the ""Two Tumblers,"" staggers homeward in an Euclidian-figured course, laden with Christmas gooel things ; over his shoulder, in a canvas bag, whoso two enrls his hands are occupied in catching-, he carries flour, sugar, raisins and currants, and eggs, under his arm a gammon of bacon, while from each side pocket protrudes the neck of a bottle of fruity old port and of brandy. Poor Tim, deceived by treacherous and frolicsome ""Jack Frost,"" takes a short cut across the frozen river, the ice gives way, and in another second he was the deepest thinker—no Hnher—you ever heard of. When he scrambles out bacon and wine arc gone, and the sack is wet through and through, so in despair he plies himself with the brandy, and becomes so maudlin that, "" to keep _th-?. nick warm,'' he twin's some, into it. At home at last, he is so treated by good Mrs. Blink that he flings away from him the cause of his misfortunes, the unfortunate sack, and where does it fall but into a pot then boiling on a fire. Midnight arrives, and with it fairies and Father Christmas, who in kindness waves over the pot an enchanting wand, joining its contents into a circular mass. And so when miserable Tim awakes in the morning he is conscious of a peculiar, novel, delicious odour, he rushes to the fire, and finds to his delight—the first Plum Pudding. In the second story, ""The Fairy of Fashion,"" there are hits that call to mind some of Thackeray's Christinas stories. (_Jhristalina, the pearl of the fairy court ladies, has one wish ungratilied—she would dress like a mortal fashionable beauty. How she. _succeeids in her vain desire;, and the ruin it entails on her, is shown in the progress of tho tale, which, by the way, contains more puns than any other.

26;It is not often in these days that we come across good fairy tales which are not translations. English and American writers do not excel in imaginative literature. The scientific spirit of the nineteenth century has killed the creative spirit, and we even find children in these degenerate days who only like stories of ‘real people’ and who are growing up with no knowledge of the world of dreams and fancies, dead to anything that is not a hard, practical fact.  The fairy tales before us from the pen of Oscar Wilde are the best of his literary productions. They show that he can do something more than adore a sunflower and worship a lily and that he really does possess a delicate fancy and a fine imagination. There is a peculiar and fascinating charm about the dainty little yolume before us and every one of the five fairy tales it contains is delightful reading. First there is the story of “The Happy Prince,” with its pathetic account of the softening of his hard lead heart.

29;"Since Hans Andersen published his last volume a more charming selection of stories than Mr. Oscar Wilde's 'Happy Prince and Other Tales' has not appeared. The lightness and delicacy of touch, the tenderness, the quaint humour with a soupçon of satire that is invariably clever, the gentleness and the unaffected pathos---all those characteristics which made Hans Andersen the 'most fascinating of story-writers, are to be found in every tale in the present collection. More worthy of remark still, is the foot that the spiritual feeling which runs through so many of Hans Andersen's stories is to be found in almost every page of Mr. Oscar Wilde's volume. That childlike simplicity and grace, so rarely to be met with in stories for children, but so indispensable to this form of literature, may also be found in every page, and entitle the author to be regarded as the most accomplished artist who has set about the difficult task of moulding these prose-poems to stimulate the imagination and to direct into right channels the overflowing fancy of young people. It might be thought that a writer like Mr. Wilde, who possesses so highly-cultured an artistic faculty, would overelaborate such a dainty little story as 'The Happy Prince', thereby giving it an artificial, if not an affected, tone; but the author proves himself to be so admirable an artist hat he even knows when to discard every semblance of art, and to appeal directly to the heart of an audience. This must be noticed in almost every story in the collection. There is no affectation of feeling--children are the first to perceive anything of this sort, and ecline to be moved by it to tears or even to thought--but the author is invariably in touch with the little circle gathered round him, and never lets a stilted or unnatural sentence escape from his lips. He never ceases to be entertaining, and this is equivalent to stating that he never becomes didactic. Children have to endure enough that is didactic without having their storybooks written in in this strain. As for the 'moral' in these tales it appears not at the end of each, like the red danger-signal at the end of a train--for people to avoid, but it is to be found in every sentence in the book. The child---nay, the mind, who does not feel the better for reading such a tale as 'The Happy Prince' is to be pitied. 'The Nightingale and the Rose' is not so pathetic, but it is equally clever. The 'moral' is Mr Oscar Wilde's satiric vein. The student who has been disappointed in love, exclaims, 'What a silly thing Love is! It is not half so useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen and making one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics'… Nothing could be better than this, which may be accepted as an example of the quaint humour of the volume. The story of 'The Devoted Friend' is a charming satire upon the sentamentalists [sic]. 'The Remarkable Rocket' abounds in subtle touches of the same character, which cannot but be relished by old as well as young readers. The book is rendered additionally charming by the beautiful binding and the delicately-drawn illustrations by Mr Walter Crane and Jacomb Hood.";The Happy Prince and Other Tales;1;Original contemporary review;1888;7;3;Belfast News Letter;United Kingdom;CLI;22774;2;;Newspapers by Ancestry;https://www.https://www.newspapers.com /image/388182295/;2021-01-07;2021-01-07;2025-03-18;
30;"We have read worse fairy stories than '*The Happy Prince and Other Tales*' by Oscar Wilde (David Nutt), and many very much better. The masterpieces in the way of fairy stories have, surely, been already written; and no man can fairly hope, in this country, and at this period, to come near the great models. Fairy stories today must necessarily be ghosts and echoes of other fairy stories; and ghosts and echoes Mr. Wilde's stories are---ghosts of Hans Andersen, echoes of 'Carmen Sylva'. 'The Happy Prince' is the best; 'The Remarkable Rocket' the funniest. They are all well written, and they at least serve to show how admirably English printers can print if they try. The illustrations are by Messrs, Walter Crane and Jacomb Hood, and they too, are admirable.

31;"A very dainty little book has been produced by Mr. Oscar Wilde and Mr. Walter Crane, The stories are not very strong as to plot, but the style is delightful, easy, and flowing, and never ' precious’. The covert humour is of that better kind which comes so near to tears, The stories are scarcely for children, but rather for their grown-up admirers. What has a child to do with the rose which is perfected by the nightingale's self-sacrifice, who, for lore's sake, 'leans her breast until a thorn', and, dying, is absorbed into tho most beautiful rose in the world? Even the story of the selfish giant whose trees languish while the children are excluded, a story which ends with a suggestion of the legend of St. Christopher, is scarcely for children. But the great unsuitability lies in the note of wasted goodness, which is struck with a powerful hand. Virtue should never fail of its reward in a child's story; whereas Mr, Oscar Wilde has let his imagination play among the sad realities of life. The story of the miller in particular, with the fine talk about friendship and his cruel usage of his little friend, touches the deeper pathos of life: and when the generous devotion and self-forgetfulness of Hans ends in a swift and unheroic death---as the world counts heroism,---we recognise the irony of fate, which has no existence for a child. The self-importance of the miller and also of the Remarkable Rocket is full of clever hits at coxcombs, Mr. Oscar Wilde must have conceived the story of the Happy Prince as he sat one day in the enclosure which surrounds the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens, But our Golden Prince has not yet found out a way to make us happy by the disposal of his burnished surface.

32;"MR. OSCAR WILDE'S FAIRY TALES It would seem to be a very difficult task to be original in fairy tales---harder, even, than in most 'walks of literature', where, as Emerson reminded us, 'everything has been said before'. To write an original story for children---which shall at the same time be readable and amusing---the author of ' Alice in Wonderland ' has, perhaps, attained nearest, ir this generation, to that ideal of perfection. But Mr. Oscar Wilde, if he echoes Hans Andersen, echoes him very pleasantly. 'These five tales are all cleverly told, and contain some pretty flights of imagination, many quaint conceits, and plenty of smart sayings. If it was Andersen's one fault that he soared occasionally above the children's heads, no one will be inclined to blame Mr. Oscar Wilde for that---for is it not the fashion of the present day to write neither exclusively for children nor for 'grownups', but for both (or neither)? The stories have 'a moral', not & la Mrs. Sherwood, but daintily hidden, for, as Mr. Wilde makes a duck say to a linnet (in a tale called 'The Devoted Friend'), 'to tell a story with a moral is always a very dangerous thing to do'. 'Every good story-teller', a waterrat goes on to inform us, 'now-a-days starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle, That is the new method. I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man, He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark he always answered, 'Pooh!' A recipe is given for friendship in the same story, 'A true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain. Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good'. Mr, Oscar Wilde is rather severe on young ladies of the present day. Here is an extract from the first story, 'The Happy Prince': ' A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. 'How wonderful the stars are;' he said to her, 'and how wonderfal is the power of love!' 'I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State ball', she answered; 'I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy. ' A student listening to a nightingale, pulls a note-book and a lead pencil out of his pocket. 'She has form', be said to himself; 'has she got feeling? Tam afraid not; in fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity... , Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice, What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good!' It would be a shame to extract any more of the plums with which this little volume is filled, The book is very prettily got up, and the illustrations are by Mr. Walter Crane and Mr. Jacomb Hood. The author of the 'Baby's Opera' is, we need not say, an ideal illustrator of fairy tales; and some of the children in Mr. Jacomb Hood's vignettes seem to have stepped out of his pretty picture in this year's Grosvenor, Indeed, if we are not mistaken, one of the vignettes is a sketch of the leading group in that composition.";The Happy Prince and Other Tales;1;Original contemporary review;1888;6;4;The Pall Mall Gazette;United Kingdom;;;;;Newspapers by Ancestry;https://www.newspapers.com ;2021-01-07;2021-01-07;;
33;Those people who have known Oscar Wilde only as an eccentric esthete, writing 'soulfully intense' poetry, may perhaps be surprised to learn that he possesses true literary ability, which has shown itself from time to time in some really excellent work. Under the title of '*The Happy Prince, and Other Tales*', he has presented a collection of short fairy stories, some of which deserve to be classed with the best that has ever been written in that line. The style is excellent and the thought full of refinement, which finds expression in beautiful language. Perhaps the two most charming stories are the first one, which gives its name to the volume, and another, called 'The Selfish Giant'. The book is attractively bound in cloth covers of dainty coloring, and its artistic and appropriate illustrations, by Walter Craine and Jacomb Hood, add much to its value and beauty.;The Happy Prince and Other Tales;1;Original contemporary review;1888;10;6;The Public Opinion;United States of America;5;26;571;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2649847&seq=705;2021-01-07;2021-01-07;2025-01-21;

35;Oscar Wilde has written some clever and readable fairy stories which are published under the title of 'The Happy Prince and other Tales' (Roberts, $1.00). The tales are, apparently, written with a purpose, and are champ's Career' and 'The Egoist'. The success of this edition indicates that the taste for Meredith is growing.

36;"That Mr Oscar Wilde is an 'æsthete' of course everybody knows, That he is a poet of remark. able sweetness, if somewhat of the fleshly school, all persons of culture know, 'That he is now the editor of a ladies' journal and is deeply concerned with matters of dress and fasbion is also no secret; but that he is a charming writer of fairy tales the present volume for the first time reveals. It is difficult to speak too highly of these tales. There are five of them, and each with a charm of its own, so that one can hardly decide which is best. The story of 'The Happy Prince' is the conception of a poet and the execution of an artist. Even still more poetical is 'The Nightingale and the Rose', a prose idyll with a most prosaic but truthful ending, 'The story of 'The Devoted Friend' is perhaps too much of a satire to be so well appreciated by young readers as it deserves, but it is very clever; while the story of 'The Remarkable Rocket' has a moral which the youngest who runs may read. The grace of Mr Oscar Wilde's narrative is not less conspicuous than the humour and shrewd sarcasm which sparkle through it.

37;"In the volume before us Mr. Oscar Wilde comes forward in a new and favourable light as a writer of fairy tales. 'The 'Happy Prince' and the four accompanying tales are full of graceful fancies and quaint conceits, and will afford equal pleasure to grown-up and to youthful readers. High spirits and buoyancy are not to be looked for in these stories, but the best of them are marked by pathos and poetic feeling, relieved by humorous touches, generally of a very happy kind. The two concluding tales are written in a satirical strain that borders on the cynical; but the selfishness and folly at which they are aimed are fair objects for satire.
The statue of the Happy Prince stood high above the city on a tall column. ' He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he bad two bright sapphires, and a large ruby glowed on his sword-hilt'. A swallow, off to Egypt for the winter, alighted on the statue. His rest was disturbed by the tears that fell from the eyes of the Happy Prince, weeping over a poor mother and her sick child. 'Swallow', said the Prince, who must have been a countryman of Mr. Wilde's, 'will you not bring (sic) her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?' The swallow did not like it at first, but she consented to stay and bring---or take---the ruby to the poor widow. Next day the swallow was anxious to be off, but the Prince pressed him to stay and do another kindness.
[The Poor Student]
...
The Selfish Giant
' The Selfish Giant' is a very happy and beautiful apologue, which is not without a present application.
...
The giant got no Spring or Summer until he let the children in, It would be well if a like treatment could be applied to some giants with empty gardens not a hundred miles from Fleet-street. But the prettiest story among the number is that of 'The Nightingale and the Rose'. A young student was searching everywhere for a red rose, and could not find one. The girl he loved bad promised to dance with him if he brought her one. What, he thought, was the use of all his learning if for the want of a red rose his life was made wretched. 'Here, at last, is a true lover', said the Nightingale. 'Night after night have I sang of him, though I knew him not; night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him'. And she resolved to find him a rose, even though (as it turned out) it was at the sacrifice of her life.
...
The Student and the Nightingale
But the young lady was hardly worthy of such a sacrifice. 'Iam afraid it will not go with my dress', she answered; 'and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers'. So the poor student threw the rose into the gutter, and was fain to act on the advice proffered to Rousseau, to eave ladies alone and study mathematics.
We must leave the reader to make further acquaintance for himself with the pleasant conceits to be found in Mr. Wilde's book; with theduck who instructed her young : ' You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads'; with the remarkable rocket who knew he would make a sensation; and with the swallow of which all the Sparrows said : 'What a distinguished stranger' so that he enjoyed himself very much. The volume is very tastefully bound and printed, and is illustrated by such masters of the craft as Mr. Walter Crane and Mr, Jacomb Hood.

48;"AMONG the books adapted alike to young and old it would be difficult to match for charm of style or beauty of sentiment this collection of exquisite tales by Oscar Wilde. They are, indeed, veritable poems in prose, and could have been writ- ten only by one who was truly a poet at heart. Rarely have the virtues and failings of poor humanity been touched with a gentler hand than in the legends of 'The Happy Prince' and 'The Selfish Giant;' rarely has false amity been more keenly satirized than in the story of 'The Devoted Friend;' every lover should read 'The Nightingale and the Rose; ' and how many self-important people we know to whom we would like to commend a careful perusal of 'The Remarkable Rocket!' But the real charm of all these stories is in the fact that they convey a moral without indulging in bald didacticism. The grace of imagination and felicity of expression are ample sources of fascination. One reads on delighted and entranced, and at the end realizes that a great truth has been illuminated by the light of something very like genius. It is a small book as books go, but we are inclined to prophesy that few volumes of the present season will meet with a more hearty welcome. It is made, too, in a most at- tractive manner.

52;"*The Happy Prince and Other Tales*. By Oscar Wilde. Illustrated by Walter Crane and Jacomb Hood. BostonRoberts Bros. 1888. The modern fairy-tale, like the children's illustrated books of to-day, is addressed far more to the cultivated taste of the parent than to the undiscriminating fancy of the child, which only asks to be fed, no matter how simple and monotonous the food. The tellers of folk-lore stories and the honest old fairy tale, took a genuine interest in the thrilling adventures of the hero and heroine, and the inevitable triumph of innocence and virtue. But the modern fairy tale is generally cast in a studiously graceful form, a little vein of satire often runs through it, there is a sort of secret understanding with the mature reader, & constant appeal to a sophisticated intelligence underneath the simple story. The charming illustrations of Walter Crane, with the lithe, white maidens and Carpaccio-like youths, are not farther from the antiquated woodcut of knight and lady and dragon, than Hans Andersen is from the Grimms' stories. We say Hans Andersen because Mr. Wilde's tales are unmistakably modelled both in subject and treatment on the work of that most fanciful and delicious of dreamers, a sleep-walker in the land of the unreal. Any one might imagine that this passage from the ' Remarkable Rocket', had been taken from Andersen's tales. 'But I like arguments', said the Rocket. 'I hope not', said the Frog, complacently, ' arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions. Good bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance;' and the Frogswam away. ....... 'There is no good talking to him', said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; 'no good at all, for he has gone away'. Swell, that is his loss, not mine', answered the Rocket. 'I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he paid no attention. I like hearing myself talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't un-derstand a single word of what I am saying'. 'Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy', said the Dragonfly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky. How very silly of him not to stay here!' said the Rocket. 'I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind. However, I don't care a bit. Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day'. And he sauk down a little deeper into the mud. This is Hans Andersen over again, and in the Happy Prince there is the most unmistakable reminiscence of the ' Mad King's Daughter'. Mr. Wilde has advanced in age, and possibly also in sedateness, since he published his first volumes, at any rate, these little stories, trifling as they are, show that his mind has progressed in healthy line, for the stories are altogether very graceful and attractive, and are flawless in moral. 'The Devoted Friend', in particular, is a clever little tale with a moral that experience of ife has brought home to most grown people. The 'Selfish Giant' embodies a very pretty fancy and the 'Rose and the Nightingale' pays the proper tribute to Poetry and Love, the two divinities that rt. Wilde worshiped so ardently in his verse. These stories, however, have, like his verse, rather fancy than the greater gift; a faculty for language and a facility for poetic expression; but always pervaded by some dominant style, the impress of a foreign and stronger hand. Mr. Crane's three full-page illustrations are as charming as his beautiful clean-cut drawings always are, and the letter press and the pretty design on the cover are fully equal in taste and finish to English books of this class.";The Happy Prince and Other Tales;1;Original contemporary review;1888;9;29;The American: A National Weekly Journal of Politics, Literature, Science, Art, and Finance;United States of America;XVI;425;379–380;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015026083686?urlappend=%3Bseq=817%3Bownerid=13510798900904538-873;2021-08-24;2021-08-24;2025-01-21;
53;"This year the horns of Elfland announce a couple of fairy tales from widely differing sources. 'The King of the Golden River' (Lee & Shepard), written by John Ruskin, M.A., in 1841, with no other purpose than the amiable one of pleasing a child-friend, is illustrated with lively drawings by Richard Doyle. The theme is an old legend of Styria, and the treatment of the clear, straightforward kind that makes it easy to read aloud to very little people. Overall, the magic of Ruskin's style gleams like sunrise on mountaintop and valley. The second essay in fairy-lore is '*The Happy Prince, and Other Tales*', by Oscar Wilde, illustrated by Walter Crane and Jacomb Hood, and published by Roberts Brothers. The stories are gracefully and poetically phrased, after the manner of Hans Andersen; but the simplicity seems labored, and here and there a Song-of-Solomon element creeps in, which will hardly recommend the book to parents. Witness the rhapsody of the nightingale, in 'The Nightingale and the Rose'. 'Here, at last, is a true lover. His hair is as dark as the hyacinth blossom, and his lips are as red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon fis brow'. We regret to state that a rude comment already overheard from two school-boys upon the subject of this hero stigmatizes him as a ' duffer who ought to get a kick'. It is fair to point out avein of agreeable humor in some of these tales, such as the 'Devoted Friend', wherein the Duck observes that the Water-Rat has a great many good points, but for her part she has a mother's feelings, and can never look at a confirmed bachelor without tears coming into her eyes.

58;"But suppose the marriage a goal one, made 'With purest love?Then what difficulties are there, that so many unions which start in the good way fall so soon and sadly into failure and woe? Some say that making acquaintance is one of the chief dangers. They avert that it is perilous to become well known one to the other. But getting known has two sides to it. One of the sides is neatly put in 'The Remarkable Rocket', one of Oscar Wilde's charming little stories, The Rocket has-been charged with affectation by; some other discontented firework. ""'You are the rudest person I ever saw', said the Rocket, ‘and you cannot understand my friendship for the prince'. 'Why, you don't 'even know him, growled the Roman Candle. I never said I knew him', answered the Rocket, 'I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all. It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends. 'But',on the other hand, there is the familiar but good anecdote told of Charles Lamb'I Bate that man', exclaimed Lamb, 'Why', said a bystander, 'do you know him?' 'No, indeed', answered Lamb, 'if I knew him I would not hate him'"". These two views balance with an advantage on the amiable side, Do little foibles come out? So do unsuspected graces. Are great faults uncovered? So are heroic virtues. No, on the whole, becoming known is not the difficulty in marriage.

'The Happy Prince, and Other Stories', are full of charming fancies and quaint humor. Though with a distinct character of their own, they are not unworthy to compare with Hans Andersen, and it is Not easy to give higher praise than this. There is a piquant touch of contemporary satire which differentiates Mr. Wilde from the teller of pure fairy tales; but it is so delicately introduced that the illusion is not destroyed, and a child would delight in the tales without being worried or troubled by their application, while children of larger growth will enjoy them and profit by them.

60;Messrs. Roberts Brothers publish 'The Happy Prince ' and other tales, by Oscar Wilde, with illustrations by Walter Crane and Jacomb-Hood. Really, these five tales are very fine. 'The Nightingale and the Rose' tells a pathetic story of a young man who loved deeply and of a young woman who did not know the great worth of such love. Now, the plain English of it is that a young man who loves is usually honest about it, and that a young woman who does not love in return is very apt to make light of both the young man and the unaccepted lover. But a young woman who boasts of such things, usually called a 'rejected' lover, very rarely finds true love, whether in herself or in others. For she has despised the most precious thing in all the world.

89;"Those of us older readers who were brought up on the works of Mary Howitt, Miss Edgeworth, Mrs. Follen, Miss Martineau, and Jacob Abbot, have a strong feeling that nothing which has since appeared can surpass ourold favorites. They were treasured, read over and over again, their maxims and suggestions put into practice and made really a part of ourselves. The distractions of manifold magazines and floods of juvenile literature did not then exist; a few favorite books had the field to themselves, And even in modern times it is only those books which the children read over again and again that are of any real good tothem. A child's book that is worth reading but once is hardly worth reading at all. In spite of the large amount of trash which goes under the name of children's literature, there is a steady increase of good books for the young, books which as well eserve immortality as our old favorites. The style of Oscar Wilde's stories of '*The Happy Prince and Other Tales*' (Roberts) is pleasing, reminding one of the German fairy tale; and almost any child who enjoys Grimm and Hans Andersen will be pleased with this book. Each story bears amoral, not stated, but interwoven in the thread of the story. The happy Prince teaches the joy of doing good to others. He is a leaden statue covered with golden scales, set on a high pedestal from which he sees the suffering in the city and strives to relieve it by giving away all his fine adornings. At length he stands blind and bare,---his sapphire eyes, the golden scales of his armor, and the ruby from his sword, all gone. His friend, a litlle swallow, the bearer of his gifts to the poor, falls dead at his feet as the winter cold comes on, and the leaden heart of the Happy Prince breaks. 'Bring me the two most precious things in the city, said God to one of his angels; and the angel brought him the leaden heart and the dead bird'. Of the other stories in the volume, 'The Nightingale and the Rose' is the least pleasing, being too full of sentiment unsuited to children. ' The Selfish Giant', 'The Devoted Friend', and 'The Remarkable Rocket' are excellent. Though many children appreciate books of this class, still the fullest appreciation of them comes from the elder ones who see what is implied rather than spoken.

92;"Among the books adapted alike to young and old it would be difficult to match for charm of style or beauty of sentiment this collection of exquisite tales by Oscar Wilde. They are, indeed, veritable poems in prose, and could have been written only by one who was truly a poet at heart.

6;"We have the irresponsible Irishman in life, and would gladly get rid of him. We have him now in literature and in the things of the mind, and are compelled perforce to see that there is a good deal to be said for him. The men I described to you the other day under the heading, 'A Reckless Century', thought they might drink, dice, and shoot each other to their hearts' content, if they did but do it gaily and gallantly, and here now is Mr. Oscar Wilde, who does not care what strange opinions he defends or what time-honoured virtue he makes laughter of, provided he does it cleverly. Many were injured by the escapades of the rakes and duellists, but no man is likely to be the worse for Mr. Wilde's shower of paradox. We are not likely to poison any one because he writes with appreciation of Wainewright---art critic and poisoner---nor have I heard that there has been any increased mortality among deans because the good young hero of his last book tries to blow up one with an infernal machine; but upon the other hand we are likely enough to gain something of brightness and refinement from the deft and witty pages in which he sets forth these matters. 'Beer, bible, and the seven deadly virtues have made England whatshe is', wrote Mr. Wilde once; and a part of the Nemesis that has fallen upon her is a complete inability to understand anything he says. We should not find him so unintelligible---for much about him is Irish of the Irish. I see in his life and works an extravagant Celtic crusade against Anglo-Saxon stupidity. 'I labour under a perpetual fear of not being misunderstood', he wrote, a short time since, and from behind this barrier of misunderstanding he peppers John Bull with his peashooter of wit, content to know there are some few who laugh with him. There is scarcely an eminent man in London who has not one of those little peas sticking somewhere about him. 'Providence and Mr. Walter Besant have exhausted the obvious', he wrote once, to the deep indignation of Mr. Walter Besant; and of a certain notorious and clever, but coldblooded Socialist [Bernard Shaw], he said, 'he has no enemies, but is intensely disliked by all his friends'. Gradually people have begun to notice what a very great number of those little peas are lying about, and from this reckoning has sprung up a great respect for so deft a shooter, for John Bull, though he does not understand wit, respects everything that he can count up and number and prove to have bulk. He now sees beyond question that the witty sayings of this man whom he has so long despised are as plenty as the wood blocks in the pavement of Cheapside. As a last resource he has raised the cry that his tormentor is most insincere, and Mr. Wilde replies in various ways that it is quite an error to suppose that a thing is true because John Bull sincerely believes it. Upon the other hand, if he did not believe it, it might have some chance of being true. This controversy is carried on upon the part of John by the newspapers; therefore, those who only read them have as low an opinion of Mr. Wilde as those who read books have a high one. Dorian Gray with all its faults of method, is a wonderful book. The Happy Prince is a volume of as pretty fairy tales as our generation has seen; and Intentions hides within its immense paradox some of the most subtle literary criticism we are likely to see for many a long day. To this list has now been added Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and other Stories (James R.Osgood, M'Ilvaine, and Co.). It disappoints me a little, I must confess. The story it takes its name from is amusing enough in all conscience. 'The Sphinx without a Secret' has a quaint if rather meagre charm; but 'The Canterville Ghost' with its supernatural horse-play, and 'The Model Millionaire', with its conventional motive, are quite unworthy of more than a passing interest.... 
Surely we have in this story something of the same spirit that filled Ireland once with gallant, irresponsible ill-doing, but now it is in its right place making merry among the things of the mind, and laughing gaily at our most firm fixed convictions. In one other Londoner, the socialist, Mr. Bernard Shaw, I recognize the same spirit. His account of how the old Adam gradually changed into the great political economist Adam Smith is like Oscar Wilde in every way.

8;The frailest literary fabric, treated with the paradoxical brilliance and graceful epigram that this author has made entirely his own, could scarcely fail to find admiring readers of the class who prefer subtlety of style to a sensational motif. The story which occupies half the volume, and gives  its name to it, is a whimsical satire on the follies of chiromancy [sic]. Lord Arthur Savile, having been told by a palmist that he is destined to commit a murder, resigns himself to his fate with considerable philosophy, determined to get the matter over with all possible despatch, in order that he may marry a lovely girl to whom he is engaged, without misgivings as to the future. The interest centres in his ineffectual attempts to give various acquaintances their quietus, until the irony of fate supplies him with a victim. The tendency of the tale is certainly immoral, or would be so if the writer were ever in earnest. 'The Sphinx without a Secret' and 'The Model Millionaire' are both delightful, and exhibit Mr. Wilde at his best. They deal with abnormal phases of human nature, which, though rare, are, nevertheless, actual.

9;"Mr OSCAR WILDE'S volume of short tales, entitled *Lord Arthur Savile's Crime; and other Stories*, is, as might have been expected, full of clever attempts in epigram and fantasy. Nevertheless, the stories may be read as motel of defective art. Their wildly improbable and extravagantly fanciful nature suggests comparison with such works as *The Dynamiter*, but the superiority of Mr. Stevenson as an artist will at once be felt. 'However fanciful a story may be, it should yet be consistent with laws of its own, its several parts should hang together, and the style should be suitable to the subject. This is a principle of art which the true artist never allows himself to lose tight of, and in consequence his wildest tales have a logic and reality of their own, and the reader's imagination is carried along with them. But Mr. Wilde's stories are like the remembrance of & dream in waking hours; there is a complete want of harmony about them; they are not written in one key, and the style continually changes, as if the author had himself not decided what style to adopt. Moreover, though happy enough in dialogue, he seems to possess little purely narrative skill, and his style is never really dramatic because always, self-conscious and affected. Lastly, Mr. Wilde has overweighted his narrative with superfluous descriptions, and needlessly elaborate details, which, instead of adding to the vividness and general humour of the situation, seem out of place, and therefore heavy.
 Lord Arthur Savile's Crime is the story of a young man, of excellent character and benevolent disposition, who is told by a chiromantist that 'Murder' is written on the palm of his hand, and that he is fated to kill some one. He is engaged to a charming young lady, but feels that to marry her with this crime still hanging over him would be inconsistent with his high principles. He must commit his crime first, and then 'he could take her to his arms, knowing that she would never have to blush for him, never have to hang her head in shame'. Putting all selfish considerations aside, therefore, he at once begins to search for a victim, and first tries to poison an old lady. 'This failing, he next attempts to blow up his uncle, the Dean of Chichester, but with no satisfactory results. Depressed and discouraged by these failures, he walks one night down to the Thames Embankment. There be discovers the little chiromantist, who is the author of all his troubles, leaning over the parapet :  >>A brilliant idea flashed across him, and he stole softly up behind. Ina moment he bad seized Mr. Podgers by the legs and flung him into the Thames. There was a coarse oath, a heavy splash, and all was still Lord Arthur looked anxiously over, but could see nothiug of the chiromantist but a tall bat, pirouetting in an eddy of moonlit water. ... At 'last he seemed to have realized the decree of destiny. He heaved a deep sigh of relief, and Sybil's name came to bis lips.   >>'Have you dropped anything, sir?' said a voice behind him suddenly.  He turned round and saw a policeman with a bull's eye lantern, >>'Nothing of any importance, sergeant', he answered smiling.    There is abundance of humour, if not of novelty, in the idea of this story, yet somehow the reader is left with an impression that the idea is much better than the treatment of it. The variety of tone which we have already noticed produces a feeling of dissatisfaction and unrest. The opening, with its cynical remarks end reflections on society and life in general, reminds one of Dorian Gray. The author then proceeds in highflown melodramatic language to describe in a ludicrously elaborate way the horror of the hero when he is made aware of his fate; and then 'once more the style changes abruptly, and becomes as farcical as that of Mr. Anstey. The same incongruity occurs in 'The Canterville Ghost'. Again the idea is so good that one regrets it has not been more satisfactorily worked out. A haunted house is sold by a 'degenerate heir to an American family. Hitherto the ghost has had it all his own way, and has successfully haunted for several centuries; but, after the United States minister, his wife, bis daughter, and his twin sons are established at Canterville Chase, he is mortified and insulted every time he appears by finding that he can in no way terrify or appal them, and is merely a butt for the Practical jokes of the twins. They frighten him with a bogey of their own making, they rub out his ineradicable bloodstain with 'Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent'. The father presents him with a bottle of the 'Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator' to oil his chains, and the mother---who is 'an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language '---offers him a bottle of 'Dr. Dobell's Tincture' asa cure for indigestion. But the story is spoilt by the character of the ghost himself, who is neither one thing nor the other, neither flesh nor spirit. He never eats or sleeps, and can vanish into air and assume any shape he likes; but he suffers acutely when he knocks his shine, and he trips up over his winding-sheet when he runs, and talks to the minister's daughter about 'the / cheap severity of abstract ethics'. The end, moreover, of the story is absurdly incongruous 'and out of place.  Mr. Wilde has talked, lectured, and written so much upon art that we may suppose him to be, in his own eyes, an authority on the subject. It is, therefore, the more surprising to find in these stories a want of artistic finish which we would only expect in a youthful beginner. Mr. Wilde is fond of epigram; he tells us, in the opening scene of Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, that at Lady Windermere's party there were 'several royal academicians disguised as artists'; we feel that he would himself be able to assume this disguise with greater success if he would try 'sometimes to be less clever and more natural.

Yet a subjectivity of method on his part, which all who were happy enough to see him in this country a few years ago [10] will somewhat painfully remember, nearly disappears in his stories, leaving his method freer and himself a more agreeable satirist than might have been supposed. We detect little of the rebuking knee-breeches or the exemplifying forelock here, while there is an abundance of wit and invention. 'The Canterville Ghost' and 'The Sphinx Without a Secret' are easily better than the two remaining sketches; in the former, the irreverent treatment by an American family of an English ancestral ghost is the happy subject of a happy treatment. The story which gives the book its name is a stiffish dose of trying to be funny, but its opening chapter is worth reading for as clever a picture of a social function as we have lately seen. The volume is charmingly bound and printed, only the title-page of each story betraying any eccentricity, and so we may feel that we have got off as easily as could be expected.";Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories;1;Original contemporary review;1892;2;11;The Nation;United States of America;54;1389;114;;Cove Collective;https://books.google.es/books?id=zeo4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PP12&dq=The+Nation+New+York+A+House+of+Pomegranates&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwje6dinzuH1AhUM4BoKHUDzCBoQ6AF6BAgDEAI#v=onepage&q=The%20Nation%20New%20York%20A%20House%20of%20Pomegranates&f=false;2022-02-02;2022-02-02;2025-01-17;
12;In a volume of four short stories by Mr. Oscar Wilde, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime is the most characteristic of the author's style and method. Itis described as 'astudy in duty'. Lord Arthur Savile is informed by a cheiromantist that he is destined to commit a murder. Lord Arthur accepts the decree of fate with a tranquillity tempered by impatience. He isengaged. He objects to postpone his wedding, but his ideal of duty towards his betrothed forbids him to become her husband before he has accomplished his destiny. After carefully planned but unsuccessful attempts to shorten the years of two of his relations without incurring the odium ofa scandal, he hits upon the happy expedient of drowning the cheiromantist, and squares accounts at once with fateand withher mouthpiece, In 'The Canterville Ghost', a story written in imitation of the American manner, the humour is of a more boisterous character.;Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories;1;Original contemporary review;1891;8;28;The Literary World: Choice Readings from the Best New Books, with Critical Reviews;United Kingdom;XLIV;1139;144;;Google Books;https://books.google.es/books?id=vtQZEm-gO5AC&pg=PA144;2022-03-02;2022-03-02;2025-01-17;
42;"Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, and its three companion stories, will not add to their author's reputation. Mr. Oscar Wilde's previous book, though in style florid to excess, and in sentiment shallow, had at least a certain cleverness; this quality, however, is singularly absent in at least the first three of these tales. Much the best of the series is the fourth, the short sketch entitled 'A Model Millionaire', though even this brief tale is spoilt by such commonplace would-be witticisms as 'the poor should be practical and prosaic', 'it is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating'. There is much more of this commonplace padding in the story that gives its name to the book, e.g. 'actors can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or comedy', &c., 'but in real life it is different. Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications', and so on, and so on, even to the painfully hackneyed 'the world is a stage, but the play is badly cast'. This story is an attempt to follow in the footsteps of the author of New Arabian Nights. Unfortunately for Mr. Wilde's ambition, Mr. Stevenson is a literary artist of rare originality. Such a story as this is nothing if not wrought with scrupulous delicacy of touch. It is, unfortunately, dull as well as derivative. 'The Sphinx without a Secret' is better. 'The Canterville Ghost' is, as a story, better still, though much the same kind of thing has already been far better done by Mr. Andrew Lang; but it is disfigured by some stupid vulgarisms. 'We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language'. 'And manners', an American may be prompted to add. A single example may suffice: 
>>'The subjects discussed were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority of Miss Fanny Davenport over Sara Bernhardt as an actress; the difficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in the best English houses...and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the London drawl'. 
It is the perpetration of banalities of this kind which disgusts Englishmen as well as 'cultured Americans'. One should not judge the society of a nation by that of a parish; the company of the elect by the sinners of one's own acquaintance. Mr. Wilde's verbal missiles will serve merely to assure those whom he ridicules that another not very redoubtable warrior has bestirred himself in the camps of Philistia.";Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories;1;Original contemporary review;1891;9;5;The Academy;United Kingdom;40;1009;189-202;William Sharp;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002608754&seq=210;2021-06-30;2021-06-30;2025-01-17;
45;"Oscar Wilde has desisted for space from mere paradox, and gives us (am I late in thus noticing it) Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, and other Stories. (London, J. R. Osgood, McIlvaine & Co.) Macte virtute, say I; the tag is old, but 'twill serve. If you want to laugh heartily, read Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, the story of a deeply conscientious man to whom murder very properly presents itself as a duty. Then, if you wish to laugh even more violently, read The Canterville Ghost, in which Oscar goes two or three better than Mr. W.S. Gilbert. I am specially thankful to OSCAR. When he is on humour bent, he doesn't dig me in the ribs and ask me to notice what a wonderfully funny dog he is going to be. He lets his fun take care of itself, a permission which it uses with great discretion. Please, Oscar, give us some more of the same sort, and pray introduce me once 'more later on to the Duchess of Cheshire [Virginia]. If she continues to be as delightful as she was in her sweet girlhood, I envy his Grace.";Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories;1;Original contemporary review;1891;9;9;Punch;United Kingdom;;100;144;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101076892742&seq=488;2021-06-30;2021-06-30;2025-01-21;
47;The attractive appearance of this pretty little book is hardly justified by its contents. Though we often 'admire Mr. Wilde and are always ready to acknowledge his genius in these whimsical little stories, and especially in the first which gives its title to the book, he seems to be playing with his powers and trying to make nonsense appear as though it had some undercurrent of truth, or was cast in the form of an allegory. The story is only worth reading for the witty and epigrammatic little remarks scattered through it in the characteristic Wildeian vein, such as the 'several Royal Academicians disguised as artists', who came to Lady Windermere's reception. The following speech by the same lady is redolent also of the great Oscar: ‘The proper basis for marriage is a mutual misunderstanding. No, I am not at all cynical, I have merely got experience, which, however, is very much the same thing'.;Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories;1;Original contemporary review;1891;7;25;The Publishers' Circular and General Record of British and Foreign Literature;United Kingdom;55;1308;85;;HathiTrust Digital Library;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015084434284&seq=93;2021-06-30;2021-06-30;2025-01-21;
